      "2. A social psychologist thinks that people are more likely to conform to a large crowd than to a single person. To test this hypothesis, the psychologist had either one person or five people stand on a busy walking path on campus and look up. (note: people who are in cahoots with the experimenter are called confederates). The psychologist stood nearby and counted the number of people passing by who looked up and the number who did not look up."

      "3. A psychologist is studying the effects of steroids on the aggressive behavior of male rats. Thirty rats receive twice-daily injections of a placebo, whereas another set of 30 rats receive twice-daily injections of a steroid. For one hour a day, the rats are placed in a cage together and all aggressive behaviors are recorded. For one week, lab assistants count the number of aggressive behaviors recorded to determine whether or not there is difference between the two groups of rats."

    question:
      "6. A researcher suspects that a newly discovered brain structure (the snookum) plays an important role in the desire to show affection. To test this, he administered a drug which inhibits the snookum. He tested 3 groups of people who received either: 0 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of the drug. He predicted that the more the snookum was inhibited, the less affection people would show (number of hugs and kisses to a cute, cuddly puppy)."

      "7. A researcher suspects that the amount of oxygen in the air affects how quickly yeast will grow. To test this, he varies the amount of oxygen present in 3 closed chambers (low O2, medium O2, high O2) and records the rate of yeast growth (density per square mm) in each chamber."

    question:
      "8. A soap manufacturer wants to show that their detergent (Suddsy-Clean) works better to remove tough stains compared to the leading brand (Tidey-Clean). To test this, 20 white t-shirts were purchased. On each t-shirt, 10 different types of stains were placed. Half the t-shirts were then washed with Suddsy-Clean, and the other half were washed with Tidey-Clean. Afterwards, the number of stains left on each t-shirt was recorded."
